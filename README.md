# Tableau_Challenge
In this challenge I compiled and split the data from the Citi bike site into summer months and winter months. After identifying and combining each specific monthâ€™s data I then started to compare the data from the 2 seasonal months. Of few things I noticed, for example in the city maps, was that in both summer and winter some stations maintained the most popular stations to start from due to the concentration of points on the map. This information was then reinforced by the table data which showed a clearer comparison to the cluster of the map. Another thing noticed was although the stations were the most popular there was about a 50% drop in riders in the winter months as compared to summer. Another thing that was noticed were the peak hours in which bikes were used. During both in winter and summer the bikes were used the most and the least in the morning from 7-9 AM and towards the afternoon/evening hours of 4-7 PM, although the number of bikes used once again were much higher in the summer than in the winter period. The final information I noticed was that only during the winter months do you see a larger trip duration by the younger citizens than the older citizens, and that the older citizens have a higher trip duration in the summer than the younger citizens.
